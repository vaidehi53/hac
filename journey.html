                 <p>Hemant K Arora laid the foundations of the firm in 1983 opening our doors for the first time on 14th October 1983 as a sole proprietor firm with a solo office in Roorkee. We started small serving small clients in and around Roorkee – again a small town in the then northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh.
    </p>
    <p>
    But since inception the vision of our founder was to provide the best in class professional service with a personal touch and that has greatly helped us in becoming now, a highly reputed firm of chartered accountants with its offices in four cities and a team of six partners and fifty plus team members.
    </p>
    <p>
    Over the years, we have grown into a leading accounting firm in India offering our clients an array of services in fields of auditing and assurance, tax and regulatory, consultancy and outsourcing services.
    </p>
    <p>
    
    The sole proprietor concern was converted into a partnership firm in 1992 and since then has added professionals as partners who all share the common value – a commitment to provide the clients the best professional services which are second to none.
    </p>
    <p>
    
    The partnership firm has now been converted into a limited liability partnership firm (LLP) in 2015 and also has set up an office in the financial capital of India - Mumbai enabling us to catering clients based there in a much better way.
    </p>
    <p>
    It is not just the clients that have been served very diligently, the firm has also trained and helped over a hundred graduates and CA trainees who have gone on to build successful careers elsewhere. Our alumni today are successfully serving some of most reputed corporations of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
    While our Head Office continues to be in Roorkee, today the firm also has offices in Delhi (NCR), Dehradun and Mumbai which are manned by our partners and professionals.
    </p>
    <p>
    In three decades since our inception we are still going strong and continue to travel the extra mile in service of our clients.</p>

    But since inception the vision of our founder was to provide the best in class professional service with a personal touch and that has greatly helped us in becoming now, a highly reputed firm of chartered accountants with its offices in four cities and a team of six partners and fifty plus team members.
    </p>
    <p>
    Over the years, we have grown into a leading accounting firm in India offering our clients an array of services in fields of auditing and assurance, tax and regulatory, consultancy and outsourcing services.
    </p>
    <p>
    
    The sole proprietor concern was converted into a partnership firm in 1992 and since then has added professionals as partners who all share the common value – a commitment to provide the clients the best professional services which are second to none.
    </p>
    <p>
    
    The partnership firm has now been converted into a limited liability partnership firm (LLP) in 2015 and also has set up an office in the financial capital of India - Mumbai enabling us to catering clients based there in a much better way.
